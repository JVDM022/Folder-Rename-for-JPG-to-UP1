# Project README

## Version Updates

### **V2 (Latest Version)**
- **Status**: The executable (exe) file is functioning properly.
- **Known Bug**:
  - Due to SEM generating an uneven number of y-values, repack files may experience glitches.
  - **Temporary Solution**: Manually remove certain patterns to ensure even x and y values. For example, ensure that all the maximum y-values for each x-value are the same (e.g., `x1y100`, `x2y100`, `x3y100`, etc.).

### **V1 (Archived Version)**
- **Status**: The program is functioning properly.
- **Drawback**: Requires manual input for the folder path.
- **Note**: V1 is now archived and no longer actively maintained.

- **Updates/Features**: Sort the file into main and extra folders.
