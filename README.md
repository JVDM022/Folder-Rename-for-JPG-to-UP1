Update Feb 5th 2025
V1 is currently up and running. Only draw back is to manually add the file path and names

V2 is coming. The exe file is not up and running. Currently debugging the code right now

Update: v2 has been fixed and exe is working normally

Bugs: right now, it just due to SEM generates uneven amount of y values, repack files gltiches out
temporary solutions: 
you need manually to remove some patterns to get even x values and y values. eg. all the maximum y values for each different x should be the same. x1y100, x2,y100, x3y100 etc etc

Projected Longterm solutions:
Automatically sorted in this script and put all extra patterns into a subfolder
