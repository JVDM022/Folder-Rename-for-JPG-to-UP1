## Version Updates

### **V2 (Latest Version)**
- **Status**: The executable (exe) file is functioning properly.
- **Known Bug**:
  - Due to SEM generating an uneven number of y-values, repack files may experience glitches.
  - **Temporary Solution**: Manually remove certain patterns to ensure even x and y values. For example, ensure that all the maximum y-values for each x-value are the same (e.g., `x1y100`, `x2y100`, `x3y100`, etc.).

---

### **V1 (Archived Version)**
- **Status**: The program is running locally.
- **Drawback**: Requires manual input for the folder path.
- **Note**: V1 is now archived and no longer actively maintained.

---

### **V3 (Projected Long-term Solution)**
- **Current Work**: Actively working on V3.
- **Projected Solution**: V3 will automatically sort the data and place any extra patterns into a subfolder, eliminating the need for manual adjustments.
